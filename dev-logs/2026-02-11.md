# Development Log - 2026-02-11

## 🦖 Today's Work Summary

### 🔍 Project Analysis & Refactoring
- **K3s Ansible Integration:** Analysis completed for connecting `k3s-helper` (provisioning) and `k3s-ansible-project` (configuration).
- **Automation Enhancements:**
    - Created `update_inventory.sh` to automatically fetch Multipass VM IPs and update Ansible `hosts.ini`.
    - Fixed variable naming inconsistencies between `k3s-master` and `k3s-worker` roles.
    - Completed the missing application deployment logic in the `k3s-apps` role using `kubectl apply`.
    - Created a main entry point `site.yml` to orchestrate the entire setup.

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Provisioning (In Progress)
- **Target Spec:**
    - Master: 2 CPU, 2G RAM, 10G Disk
    - Workers: 4 CPU, 2G RAM, 10G Disk (x2)
- **Status:** Attempted provisioning via `mpk3s generate`. Encountered Multipass daemon connection issues which were resolved via a clean re-installation.
- **Rollback:** Restored `mpk3s` script to its original state after an unauthorized modification attempt.

### 🚀 Future Plans
- **Open Source Preparation:** Discussion initiated regarding GitHub publication and Homebrew (`brew`) distribution.
- **Track 3 Completion:** Finalizing the bridge between `mpk3s` and Ansible for a truly "Zero-to-K8s" experience.
